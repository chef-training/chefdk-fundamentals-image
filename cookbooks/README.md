# Cookbooks

All of the linux workstations and nodes use Chef, through Packer, to configure
them correctly. For Packer it is required that all cookbooks can be found. To
make sure that this works correctly for everyone without adding additional
commands to retrieve dependencies the cookbooks and all the dependent cookbooks
are found here.

## Workstations Cookbook

Each recipe of the workstations cookbook is related to each of the various
workstations/nodes for the various courses. There are some support recipes
as well.
